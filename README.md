# Visualization
## Idea Description
The graph compares the employment rates (%) of 5 randomly selected college majors. Each bar represents a specific major on the x-axis, while its height (on the y-axis) shows the employment rate. The y-axis ranges from 0% to 100%, with grid lines to help visualize differences in employment rates. The bars are colored blue, and each bar will have a label on top to show the exact percentage. To prevent overlapping titles (because some major names may be upwards of 3 words long), major names will be wrapped onto multiple lines and positioned below the x-axis and above the y-axis. Pressing any key will randomly "reroll" the majors to a new set of five, and will redraw the chart.

The data will be obtained from [this site](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv), which was gathered from the **American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series**, and showcases the majors of all ages.
